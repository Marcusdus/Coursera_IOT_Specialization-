Garbage Monitoring System

The detection, monitoring and management of wastes is one of the primary problems of the present era. The traditional way of manually monitoring the wastes in waste bins is a cumbersome process and utilizes more human effort, time and cost which can easily be avoided with our present technologies.

One idea is to automate this by using ultrasonic sensors to measure the level of garbage and use a WiFi module to transmit real time data of the garbage amount. The Wifi module can also be used to send automatic mails in case they haven't been cleared.
