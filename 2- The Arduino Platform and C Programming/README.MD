# About this Course

The Arduino is an open-source computer hardware/software platform for building digital devices and interactive objects that can sense and control the physical world around them. In this class you will learn how the Arduino platform works in terms of the physical board and libraries and the IDE (integrated development environment). You will also learn about shields, which are smaller boards that plug into the main Arduino board to perform other functions such as sensing light, heat, GPS tracking, or providing a user interface display. The course will also cover programming the Arduino using C code and accessing the pins on the board via the software to control external devices. Please note that this course does not include discussion forums.

Upon completing this course, you will be able to:
1.       Outline the composition of the Arduino development board
2.       Describe what it means to program the board's firmware
3.       Read board schematics
4.       Install Arduino IDE
5.       Describe what "shields" are and how they are used
6.       Specify the role of libraries in the use of shields
7.       Compile and run a program
8.       Name C Variables and Types
9.       Name common C operators
